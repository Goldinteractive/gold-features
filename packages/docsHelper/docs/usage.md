There are three main use cases:

- maintain
- use
- see

For **maintenance** the corresponding documenation can be found directly in the [Repo](https://github.com/Goldinteractive/gold-features).

For **usage** simply pick a Feature here, then head to the documentation and see [How To Use](https://github.com/Goldinteractive/gold-features#how-to-use-a-feature). The configuration (both HTML & JS) example can be found right here in the docs. Just expand the JS or HTML section and copy the code.

In order to **see** a proper demo for the feature, click on the feature and then open up the **external view** using the arrow indicator in the top left corner. Iframe preview is only appropriate for basic visualization. Many features have minor issues in iframe mode.
