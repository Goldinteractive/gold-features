# Gallery

> There is an issue running Gallery in the Stylemark iframe. Open up the `external view` which works properly

The feature requires a global template for the overlay. Make sure to include a node with `data-pswp`.

Create a container element using the `data-feature` attribute. The feature will then search nodes with `data-figure`. Each `figure` must contain `data-source`, `data-width` and `data-height`. If desired the optional configurations `data-thumbnail` and `data-caption` can be used.
